Iâ€™m Daniel Saunders, a web designer and developer, reader, and writer with a wide range of interests, as you might have gathered from looking around this site.

I've been freelancing for around 8 years, during which time I've worked on many different types of graphic design and web development projects. Check out my [web studio site](https://www.ds-design-studio.com) for a selection of recent projects and if you're interested in working together!

The throughline of this site is a chronicle of many years of transformations and transitions, whether in my thinking about [existence](/posts/tags/philosophy), [history](/posts/tags/history), [religion](/posts/tags/religion), [design](/posts/tags/design), or the [world wide web](/posts/tags/web-development).

What I've learned from using this site as a real-time, sometimes messy space to work out these ideas is that I am someone who wants to explore boundaries, who disdains rigid orthodoxies, and who is always seeking where to enact that modernist injunction to "make it new". Maybe you'll find something here that sparks a feeling of exploration and discovery.
