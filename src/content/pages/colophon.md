The design of this site is primarly centered around the two main typefacesâ€”the fantastic [Ambra Sans](https://www.zetafonts.com/ambra-sans) (Zetafonts) for body text and the even more spectacular [Kensington](https://fortfoundry.com/fonts/kensington) (Fort Foundry) for headings. Both are delightfully quirky, but they each also maintain an expressive elegance that I find works very well for online reading. Kensington also includes all of the florals, ornaments, and symbols that I use throughout the site. [Recursive Mono](https://www.recursive.design) (ArrowType) is used for all code examples.

This site is proudly hand-crafted with [Astro](https://astro.build) and is deployed as a static site on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/astro). Posts are written in Markdown/MDX, with additional content coming from Airtable (i.e., book and library data). No AI was used, or will be used, at any point in the process.
