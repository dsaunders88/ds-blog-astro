The design of this site is primarly centered around the two main typefaces—the fantastic [Ambra Sans](https://www.zetafonts.com/ambra-sans) (Zetafonts) for body text and the even more spectacular [Kensington](https://fortfoundry.com/fonts/kensington) (Fort Foundry) for headings. Both are delightfully quirky, but they each also maintain an expressive elegance that I find works very well for online reading. Kensington also includes all of the florals, ornaments, and symbols that I use throughout the site. [Recursive Mono](https://www.recursive.design) (ArrowType) is used for all code examples, which are presented in the [Vesper theme](https://shiki.matsu.io/themes) from the Shiki package.

This site is proudly hand-crafted with [Astro](https://astro.build) and is deployed as a static site on [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/framework-guides/web-apps/astro). Posts are written in Markdown/MDX, with additional content coming from Airtable (i.e., book and library data). No AI was used, or will be used, at any point in the process. Read more about the making of this site in the post, "[New Astro Site, 2025](/posts/notes/new-astro-site-2025)."
