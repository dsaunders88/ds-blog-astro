After nearly 8 years of working for myself as a full-time freelancer, I am switching things up in a pretty big way. As of July, I am now an official employee of the University of California, Los Angeles (I guess I'm a Bruin now!). The role is perfectly suited to meâ€”it is part time, so I am still able to freelance; it combines graphic design and web development responsibilities, which are my bread and butter; and it supports the [Pourdavoud Institute](https://pourdavoud.ucla.edu) in the department of Ancient Near Eastern Languages and Cultlures, a world which overlaps with [some of my interests](/posts/tags/religion). The UCLA campus is absolutely gorgeous, and it feels great to be in an academic setting. I'm looking forward to the opportunity!
