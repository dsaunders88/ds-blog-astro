A brief update to accompany the redesign of this site in the summer of 2025: I continue to split my work time between my freelance [web design studio](https://ds-design-studio.com) and the [Pourdavoud Institute](https://pourdavoud.ucla.edu) at UCLA, as their Digital Designer and Web Developer. My main extracurricular activity at the moment is practicing tai chi in the [Wu style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu-style_tai_chi); I attend an [excellent studio class](https://www.yelp.com/biz/eagle-claw-kung-fu-and-tai-chi-chuan-san-gabriel-2?osq=Eagle+Claw+Tai+Chi+Chuan) a few times a week to hone the 108-form sequence. A few months ago, our Sifu began teaching us the "Datmo Gim" sword form, which features the Chinese straight sword (_jian_) and is said to be the technique that [Bodhidharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodhidharma) taught to the monks at the Shaolin temple.

In June, my partner Caitlyn and I celebrated our 10-year wedding anniversary and promptly got Covid. Even with the latest vaccine, it's still a beastâ€”I was laid out for about a week. Stay careful out there!
