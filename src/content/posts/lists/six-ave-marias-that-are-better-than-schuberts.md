If you have ever been to a Catholic wedding, or seen *Fantasia*, or listened to one of those insipid "Classical Music Greatest Hits" compilations (most likely one with a cover featuring a photo of roses on a piano), or searched "well-dressed man with angelic face singing very high" on YouTube, chances are you are familiar with Franz Schubert's Ave Maria—a consoling, elegant work, by no means his greatest, but certainly genius in its harmoniousness and Romantic power (this is Schubert, after all). This piece of music has become, apart from Gounod's nineteenth-century mashup of Bach, probably the most popular rendition of this text.

I bring this up because, although I adore Schubert, the history of classical music is full of magnificent Ave Marias which have been undeservedly eclipsed by the fame of this piece. Thus, as we begin this new church year with the season of Advent, the season in which the Ave Maria grows in significance and captivates the imagination, I have compiled a list of six other versions, perhaps lesser known but to me more interesting, more evocative, and more profound than Schubert's version.

That judgment is wholly subjective, of course; but at the very least, this partial list hints at how ardent and expansive the church's response has been, across the ages, to this singular text. It is a text at once full of serenity, wonder, profundity, and sweetness; these pieces, in their different ways, manage to capture all of those elements.

## 1. Felix Mendelssohn

Ave maria, from Kirchenmusik (Op.23, 1830)

Mendelssohn's Ave Maria begins with a haunting and chant-like tenor solo, out of which blooms, like an epiphany, the fullness of an eight-part choir. From there it becomes a dynamic, expressive, and colorful illustration of the text, heightened by the tension between classical and Romantic forms.

Its middle section (con moto) is what truly sets it apart; here, a turbulent accompaniment propels the choir forward as it antiphonally calls out to Mary in both praise and succor. A final restatement of the first movement brings the piece around full circle, ending on a luminous note.

## 2. Robert Parsons

Ave Maria (ca. 1550)

Parsons was a member of that generation who came of age at the same time as the English Reformation. His body of work, which still forms part of the Anglican choral repertoire, was an attempt to instill the old Catholic forms with the new Protestant spirituality (and sometimes, like his countryman Tallis, with the vernacular English). His Ave Maria is a model of Renaissance polyphony, which was the standard compositional form for sacred motets; each voice part enters on an imitative phrase, which build to form an intricate, contrapuntal texture.

Of particular note is the final extended "Amen." Not merely a closing statement to what has come before, it is a mini-motet in itself, developing the musical theme to its fullest expression before being drawn irresistibly to its close.

## 3. Franz Biebl

Ave Maria (1964)

Biebl's Ave Maria might have remained in relative obscurity had it not been for the male choral ensemble Chanticleer, who have made it a staple of their repertoire. (It is a most fitting match; in my opinion, Chanticleer's performance of the piece sets the bar for all others.) The piece is more precisely a setting of the Angelus, a devotional prayer alternating between versicles and responses on the Incarnation and the Hail Mary.

The juxtaposition of the versicles and responses, set as monophonic chant, and the repeating refrains of the Ave Marias, sung antiphonally by the choir and soloists, lends the piece both depth and simplicity. The resulting effect is one of consolation, warmth, and holiness. As in the Parsons, the "Amen" in this piece is striking—the melodic phrases building ever higher, culminating in a final chord that is pure radiance.

## 4. Anton Bruckner

Ave Maria (WAB 6, 1867)

Bruckner's Ave Maria stands out to me as the most emotionally felt of the pieces on this list—which makes sense, as his earnest devoutness is well-known. Like a passionate love letter, it is full of both rapture and anguish, tumult and sweetness, all of which are inextricably merged together in Bruckner's signature tonal style. Traditional musical forms are recovered yet renewed by the infusion of Romantic developments like dissonance, tone painting, and abrupt chord changes. The result is both an artistic and theological masterpiece.

## 5. Sergei Rachmaninov

Bogoroditse Devo, from All-Night Vigil (Op. 37, 1915)

In contrast to the Western tradition, the Hail Mary prayer in the Orthodox tradition begins with the striking phrase, "Theotokos Virgin, rejoice." By opening with Mary's ancient title as the God-bearer, the prayer immediately establishes a solemn theological and worshipful tone. Rachmaninov's otherworldly setting, part of his *All-Night Vigil* (perhaps my favorite choral piece of all time), is the hardest for me to describe.

If pieces like Bruckner's Ave Maria feel like a love letter to Mary on a human, personal scale, Rachmaninov's piece is an objective statement of cosmic, theological fact. Like Dante's vision of the Empyrean in the Paradiso, this piece (and the *All-Night Vigil* as a whole) is one of the great works of the Christian imagination, a work that sees beyond this dark world into a realm of pure, celestial light.

## 6. Josquin

Ave Maria ... Virgo serena (1485)

I include Josquin's Ave Maria on this list, even though it is not a setting of the traditional text. It is, however, one of the most beautiful sacred choral pieces I have heard (and is considered one of the most perfect compositions of the fifteenth, or any, century).

Composed according to that Franco-Flemish Renaissance style of which Josquin is the greatest exemplar, the piece is full of vast spaces, in which sometimes only two voices come together and move apart in an ever-changing contrapuntal dance. The effect is one of balance between stasis and flux, permanence and motion, of which late-Medieval and Renaissance music is so full.
